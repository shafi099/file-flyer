When a user chooses the "Send/Encode" option, FileFlyer accepts files via drag-and-drop or the "Browse Files" option that want to be converted to text format. It gives the .zip file which contains .txtÂ of the chosen files, and the file is then downloaded automatically.
Please be patient as the file may take some time to convert to text format before being compressed into a.zip file because we used free hosting.

The FileFlyer accepts the.zip file containing the.txt file when the user clicks "Receive/Decode" and then displays the available files for download. You can choose to download individual files or all of them.
